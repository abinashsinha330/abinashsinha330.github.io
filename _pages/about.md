Hello! I hope everyone who visits me here eventually gets to know where I am heading to in terms of pursuits. I completed my M.S. from University of Minnesota advised by Dr. Jaideep Srivastava. My research interests are in deep learning, machine learning, sequential recommender system and educational data analytics. Most likely, I am going to get my hands dirty in sustainability analytics. The core reason for that pursuit being the belief that sustainability should be the core to whatever we do. Am I right?
