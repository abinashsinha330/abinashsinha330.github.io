Hello! I hope everyone who visits me here eventually gets to know where I am heading to in terms of my pursuits. I completed my M.S. from University of Minnesota advised by Dr. Jaideep Srivastava. Previously, I was advised by Dr. Lucy Fortson, working as a *Graduate Research Assistant* on an NSF-funded project related to [LSST](https://www.lsst.org/). My research interests are in deep learning, machine learning, sequential recommender system and educational data analytics.

I would love to be able to get my hands dirty in sustainability analytics someday. The reason being that I am beginning to believe that sustainability should be the core to whatever we do.

Apart from academia, I love playing soccer and badminton, basically into sports. Other interests include dancing, hiking and kayaking. I am a huge soccer nerd (in fact one of my projects was related to soccer analytics!). Though, I prefer calling it football.

## Research

My current research is on recommending video in MOOCs using self-supervised learning by understanding their intrinsic intentions during a student's learning journey. Through this short research journey, I have gotten acquainted with the world of representation learning for sequential data. Previously, I worked on analyzing time-series data of simulated [LSST](https://www.lsst.org/) observations to build a deep learning framework to identify the kind of astronomical event that caused those observations.
